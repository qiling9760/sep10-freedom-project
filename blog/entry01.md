# Entry 1: Toys and Puzzles 
#### 10/24/23

## Why am I intrested in toys and puzzles and not others? 
When I am required to think up an idea for my freedom project, **Toys/Puzzles** is not my first choice, it was **Animation**. I am always looking foward to become a game designer and animation is a big part in games. However, animation involves large amount of art and I have no interest in art. To not suffer myself in researching something I would get bored to, I came up with my second idea, which is **Toys/Puzzles**. I am not a child that grow up with a lot of toys. When I am a kid, everything I have are my toys, no matter how simple they are. Now, I am a teenager and I am still obssessed with the toys that the new generation has. They are more interactive and has more functions, so different from what I have when I was a kid. This made me wondered how has toys changed from the past and how technology has involved in this developement. 

When I searched up "toys in the past and present," I was able to figure out the difference between past toys and present toys in a webside called ["How have toys changed."](https://www.twinkl.com/homework-help/history-homework-help/toys-from-the-past/how-have-toys-changed) This article tells how the physcial material of the toys were changed and tells how present toys uses batteries and have screens. The article ["The Future of Toys: How Tech is Molding the Toy Industry"](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/future-toys-how-tech-molding-toy-industry-ted-curtin#%253A~%253Atext%253DA%2520smart%2520toy%2520has%2520its%252Cplay%2520value%2520or%2520educational%2520features.) talks more about how technology will impact the toy indutury in the future.
