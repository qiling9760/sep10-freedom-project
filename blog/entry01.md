# Entry 1: Toys and Puzzles 
#### 10/24/23

## Why am I intrested in Toys and Puzzles and not others? 
When I was required to think up an idea for my freedom project, **Toys/Puzzles** was not my first choice; it was **Animation**. I always look forward to becoming a game designer, and animation is a big part of games. However, animation involves a large amount of art, and I have no interest in art. To avoid suffering in researching something I would get bored with, I came up with my second idea: Toys/Puzzles. I am not a child that grew up with a lot of toys. As a kid, everything I had was my toys, no matter how simple they were. Now, I am a teenager and obsessed with the new generation's toys. They are more interactive and have more functions, so different from what I have as a kid. This made me wonder how toys have changed from the past and how technology has been involved in this development.

## Sources that helped me to get started
When I searched "Toys in the past and present," I figured out the difference between past toys and present toys in a website called ["How have toys changed"](https://www.twinkl.com/homework-help/history-homework-help/toys-from-the-past/how-have-toys-changed). This article tells how toys have changed physically from the past. The article ["The Future of Toys: How Tech is Molding the Toy Industry"](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/future-toys-how-tech-molding-toy-industry-ted-curtin#%253A~%253Atext%253DA%2520smart%2520toy%2520has%2520its%252Cplay%2520value%2520or%2520educational%2520features.) discusses how technology will impact the toy industry in the future. These two articles provided ideas I could write for Part A and Part B of the freedom project.

## Engineering Design Process 
I am on step one and part of step two of the process: **Define the problem** and **Research the problem**. The problem I am trying to solve is to **figure out the impacts technology had on toys/puzzles**. I found articles that showed how technology is already involved in the development of toys and how it will impact the industry in the future. From researching and reading the articles, I understand that technology has benefits and negatives when added to toys.

## Skills
### How to Google
One skill that I have learned is **Googling**. I understand what I should type in the search box to get websites with the information I want regarding Googling. The freedom project is about technology in different areas, so I needed to have the word **technology** when researching. From the article ["What are smart toys and why do they matter?"](https://www.smarttoyawards.org/learn-more.html), I noticed toys that use AI are considered **smart toys**, and AI is a technological advancement. So, when I want to learn more about technology-related toys, I can search for **"smart toys"** on Google.

### Time Management
Another skill I have learned is **Time Management**. I proved myself using time efficiently by doing work from other classes when my Spanish teacher was absent, and I finished with the work he posted. This way, I can spend more time at home doing my SEP work and finishing my blog. I used my free time and took advantage of tutoring to save time to complete my assignments before the due date. 

## Summary
I am still searching for articles that might help me to do my freedom project, and I am excited to see the complete project at the end of the year.
