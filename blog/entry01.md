# Entry 1: Toys and Puzzles 
#### 10/24/23

## Why am I intrested in toys and puzzles and not others? 
When I am required to think up an idea for my freedom project, **Toys/Puzzles** is not my first choice, it was **Animation**. I am always looking foward to become a game designer and animation is a big part in games. However, animation involves large amount of art and I have no interest in art. To not suffer myself in researching something I would get bored to, I came up with my second idea, which is **Toys/Puzzles**. I am not a child that grow up with a lot of toys. When I am a kid, everything I have are my toys, no matter how simple they are. Now, I am a teenager and I am still obssessed with the toys that the new generation has. They are more interactive and has more functions, so different from what I have when I was a kid. This made me wondered how has toys changed from the past and how technology has involved in this developement. 

## Sources that helped me to get started
When I searched up "Toys in the past and present," I was able to figure out the difference between past toys and present toys in a webside called ["How have toys changed."](https://www.twinkl.com/homework-help/history-homework-help/toys-from-the-past/how-have-toys-changed) This article tells how toys has changed physically. The article ["The Future of Toys: How Tech is Molding the Toy Industry"](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/future-toys-how-tech-molding-toy-industry-ted-curtin#%253A~%253Atext%253DA%2520smart%2520toy%2520has%2520its%252Cplay%2520value%2520or%2520educational%2520features.) talks more about how technology will impact the toy indutury in the future, which provides me ideas for Part B of my freedom project. 

## Engineering Design Process 
I am on step one and maybe part of step two of process, which is **Define the problem** and **Research the problem**. The problem I try to solve is to **figure out the impacts technology had on toys/puzzles**. I had found articles that showed how technology already involved in the developement of toys and how it will impact the industry in the future. From researching and reading the articles, I understand that technology had both benefits and negatives when it was added to toys. 

## Skills
### How to Google
One skill that I have learned is **Googleling**. What comes to googleling is I understand what I should type in the search box in order to get websites that include what I want. I understand the freedom project is about technology in different areas, so what I need to include when searching is the word **technology**. From the article ["What are smart toys and why do they matter?"](https://www.smarttoyawards.org/learn-more.html), I noticed that toys that uses AI are considered smart toys and AI is a technology advancement. So, when I want to learn more about toys that withe technology, I can search **"smart toys"** in Google.

### Time Management
Another skill I have learned is **Time Management**. I proved myself using time effciantly by doing work from other class when my Spanish teacher is absent and I finished witht the work he posted. In this way, I can spend more time at home doing my SEP work and finishing my blog. I used my free time and take advantage of tutoring in order to save time for me to complete my assignements beofre due date.
