# Entry 2 : Technologies in Toys and Puzzles 
##### 11/27/23
## Hardware Technologies
The primary technologies I searched for are 3D printing and intelligent toys. People can 3D print toys that they like using a 3D printer. Smart toys are toys that use AI in some ways.

### 3D printing
3D printing is a process that creates three-dimensional objects using a digital design. It involves both hardware and software technologies. I understood that people can 3D print toys when I saw videos about it online. So, I started searching for what people used to 3D print an object. The hardware technology involved in 3D printing toys is a 3D printer. A ToyBox 3D printer is a 3D printer that is designed for kids and is easy to use so that they can try to print toys on their own. The [ToyBox website](https://www.make.toys/toys) pairs with the printer and allows the kids to choose a design they want to print.

### Smart toys
Smarty toys can be AI smart toys or robotic smart toys. They can interact with kids and help them develop skills. An example of AI smart toys would be Hatchimals. [Hatchimals](https://spinmastersupport.helpshift.com/hc/en/8-hatchimals/faq/1740-what-is-a-hatchimal/?p=web#:~:text=Hatchimals%20really%20walk%2C%20talk%2C%20dance,Hatchimals%20%E2%80%94%20who%20will%20you%20hatch%3F) can play music and games. It involves touch sensors, a microphone, and a speaker. An example of robotic smart toys is the [SGILE RC robot](https://www.sgile.com/blogs/sgile-toy/the-perfect-sgile-remote-control-robot-for-kids). It can walk and be controlled by hand motions. Kids can also program it to make it do the things they programmed.

## Software Technologies
Some software technologies I found are puzzle games and apps that have something to do with toys.

### Puzzle games
Before games, people played physical puzzles made of wood, plastic, or other materials, for example, legos and wooden puzzles. But now, people no longer have to buy puzzles and can play online. Some puzzle games that I found are Jigsaw Puzzles, Sudoku, and Candy Crush.

### Apps that are connected to toys
The Lego AR Studio is an app that allows children to play with the digital version of the Legos. Their [website](https://www.lego.com/en-us/aboutus/news/2019/october/lego-ar-studio) discusses how children can play with the digital LEGO models in real-world environments. Another app that has to do with Lego would be [Brickit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-wx0pCpPdc). It allows you to use your leftover Lego pieces to build new stuff. It works by the user using the app and scanning their legos, and the app will show models that can be created using those legos. There is also an online Rubik's Cube Solver that helps the user solve Rubrik's Cube. The user will make the Rubik's cube model the same as their scrambled Rubik's cube, and the website will show the steps to solve the Rubik's cube.

## Engineering Design Process
I am currently on the second step, **researching the problem**. I am researching the hardware and software technologies that are used in or include toys and puzzles. The hardware I found is 3D printers, a new way to create toys, and smart toys, which are new forms of toys that have technologies. The software is primarily games and apps about puzzles and can help the user play with their toys. My next step is to **brainstorm possible solutions**, which means I need to use what I have found to conclude how technologies have changed toys and puzzles.

## Skills
### Logical Reasoning
At first, I wanted to know what technologies are used in toys, so I searched for "toys with technologies." I saw that most websites have the term **Smart toys**, so I connected smart toys with toys with technologies in them. Later in the research, I searched for "what are smart toys" and dropped their features in my notes.

### Problem Decomposition
At first, I just searched "technologies in toys" in Google, but I then made it more specific by adding what I wanted to find, such as "toys gadgets" for hardware technologies and "apps that do with toys" for software technologies. When I learned that toys with technology are called smart toys, I focused on intelligent toys. Smart toys are a broad category, and there are different types. I first picked two types of smart toys that are the most popular: AI smart toys and robotic smart toys. I then searched for examples of the smart toys for each type.
