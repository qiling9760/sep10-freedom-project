# Entry 2 : Technologies in Toys and Puzzles 
##### 11/27/23

## Hardware Technologies
The 2 major technologies that I searched deeply are 3D printing and Smart toys. People can 3D print toys that they liked using a 3D printer. Smart toys are toys that have use AI in some ways. 

### 3D printing 
3D printing is a process that creates three dimension objects using a digital design. It involves both hardware and software technologies. I understood that people can 3D print toys when I saw videos about it online. So, I start searching what did people use in order to 3D print an object. The hardware technology that involves in 3D printing toys is a 3D printer. A ToyBox 3D printer is a 3D printer that designed for kids and easy to use, so that they can try on their own to print toys. The [ToyBox](https://www.make.toys/toys) website pairs with the printer and allows the kids to pick a design they would like to print. 

## Smart toys 
Smarty toys can be AI smart toys or robotic smart toys. They can interact with kids and help them developed skills. An example of AI smart toys would be Hatchimals. Hatchimals can play music and games. It involves touch sensors, microphone, and speaker. An example of robotic smart toys is the [SGILE RC robot](https://www.sgile.com/blogs/sgile-toy/the-perfect-sgile-remote-control-robot-for-kids). It can walk and controlled by hand motions. Kids can also program it to make it do the things they programmed. 

## Software Technologies 
Some software technologies that I found are puzzle games and apps that has something to do with toys. 

### Puzzle games
Before there were games, people played physical puzzles that are made by wood, plastic, or other materials. For example, legos and wooden puzzles. But now, people don't have to buy puzzles and can play online. Some puzzle games that I found are Jigsaw Puzzles, Sudoku, and Candy Crush. 

### Apps that connected to toys 
The Lego AR Studio is an app that allows children to play with the digital version of the legos. Their [website](https://www.lego.com/en-us/aboutus/news/2019/october/lego-ar-studio) talks about how children can play with the digital LEGO models in real-world enviorment. Another app that has to do with Lego would be Brickit. It allows you to use your left over lego pieces to build new stuff. It works by the user use the app and scan their legos, the app will show up modles that can be build using those legos. There are also online Rubik's Cube Solver where it helps the user to solve Rubrik's Cube. The user will make the rubik's cube model to be the same as their scrambled rubik's cube, and the website will show the steps to solve the rubik's cube. 

## Engineering Design Process 
I am currently on the second step, which is **research the problem**. I am researching the hardware and software technologies that are used in or include toys and puzzles. The hardwares I found are 3D printers which is a new way to create toy, and smart toys are new forms of toys that include technologies. The softwares are mostly games and apps where the games are about puzzles and the apps can help the user to play with their toys. My next step is **brainstorm possible solutions** which means I need to use what I had found to conclude how has technologies change toys and puzzles. 

## Skills 

### Logical Reasoning 
At first, I want to know what technologies are used in toys,so I searched up "toys with technologies." I saw the most websites that comes up has the term **Smart toys** so I then connected smart toys with toys that has technologies in them. Later on in the research, I searched up "what are smart toys" and drop down their features in my notes. 

### Problem Decomposition 
At first, I just search "technologies in toys" in Google, but I then make it more specific by adding what I want to find such as "toys gadgets" for hardware technologies and "apps that do with toys" for software technologies. When I learned that toys with technologies are called smart toys, I put my focus in smart toys. Smart toy is a broad catergory and there are different type of smart toys. I first picked two types of smart toys that are the most popular which is AI smart toys and robotic smart toys. I then go to search examples of the smart toys for each type. 

## Hardware Technologies
The primary technologies I searched for are 3D printing and intelligent toys. People can 3D print toys that they like using a 3D printer. Smart toys are toys that use AI in some ways.

### 3D printing
3D printing is a process that creates three-dimensional objects using a digital design. It involves both hardware and software technologies. I understood that people can 3D print toys when I saw videos about it online. So, I started searching for what people used to 3D print an object. The hardware technology involved in 3D printing toys is a 3D printer. A ToyBox 3D printer is a 3D printer that is designed for kids and is easy to use so that they can try to print toys on their own. The [ToyBox website](https://www.make.toys/toys) pairs with the printer and allows the kids to choose a design they want to print.

### Smart toys
Smarty toys can be AI smart toys or robotic intelligent toys. They can interact with kids and help them develop skills. An example of AI smart toys would be Hatchimals. Hatchimals can play music and games. It involves touch sensors, a microphone, and a speaker.
