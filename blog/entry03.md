## Possible Future Technologies 
I have brainstormed ideas for possible future technologies. I get some of the ideas from technologies that already existed and think of how they can be improved. Other ideas I came up with were technologies I hope to get invented in the future. I also asked for help from my sister and partner (Ellen) to get more ideas. 


### Holography 
Holography is the production of 3 dimensional image of an object. Holograms are already in used in many industries such as visual art and architecture. My idea of using holograms in the toy industry is that toy makers can use holograms to present their products to the customers from every side of view, and customers can have a better understanding of the toy itself by looking at its 3D image. 

### Creat toys with imagination 
In my research, I know that we can use 3D printer to print toys. However, 3D printing needs the user to make a digital file of the toy before printing it. So, I have an idea that in the future, there will be a machine that can be conrtolled by the user's mind and do not need the user to waste time on creating a 3D model. When the user think of the toys they want to make in their head, the machine will automatically creat the toys the user wants. 

### AI that can act like fictional characters 
Smart toys can talk, move, and interact with kids. However, the AIs in the toys are all the same and not smart enough to communicate with kids. So in the future, I hope that there will be toys with AIs that are smart enough to act like kids' favorite characters in a book/movie/game and talk to them. The AI will collect the characterâ€™s information such as their personalities and their voices, and kids will have fun spending time and communicating with people they liked. 

### A technology that can turn life into puzzle games 
The new technology that I thought up was a smart glasses, just like VR glasses but much simpler. The smart glasses can turn ordinary events in to challenges. When the user use this smart glasses, it can will make every small things in life become a puzzle that is ready to solve.
