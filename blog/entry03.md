## Possible Future Technologies 
I have brainstormed ideas for possible future technologies. I get some of the ideas from technologies that already existed and think of how they can be improved. Other ideas I came up with were technologies I hope to get invented in the future. I also asked for help from my sister and partner (Ellen) to get more ideas. 

### Holography 
Holography is the production of 3 dimensional image of an object. Holograms could have a impact many industries such as [architecture](https://marvut.com/transforming-architectural-space-the-impact-of-hologram/ingles/#%253A~%253Atext%253DHowever%252C%2520holograms%2520go%2520further%252C%2520enabling%252C3D%2520renderings%2520of%2520their%2520designs.). My idea of using holograms in the toy industry is that toy makers can use holograms to present their products to the customers from every side of view, and customers can have a better understanding of the toy itself by looking at its 3D image. 

### Creat toys with imagination 
In my research, I know that we can use 3D printer to print toys. However, 3D printing needs the user to make a digital file of the toy before printing it. So, I have an idea that in the future, there will be a machine that can be conrtolled by the user's mind and do not need the user to waste time on creating a 3D model. When the user think of the toys they want to make in their head, the machine will automatically creat the toys the user wants. 

### AI that can act like fictional characters 
Smart toys can talk, move, and interact with kids. However, the AI in the toys are all the same and not smart enough to communicate with kids. So in the future, I hope that there will be toys with AI that are smart enough to act like kids' favorite characters in a book/movie/game and talk to them. The AI will collect the character’s information such as their personalities and their voices, and kids will have fun spending time and communicating with people they liked. 

### A technology that can turn life into puzzle games 
The new technology that I thought up was a smart glasses, just like VR glasses but much simpler. The smart glasses can turn ordinary events into challenges. When the user use this smart glasses, it can will make every small things in life become a puzzle that is ready to solve. 

### A toy that can create music based on the user's feelings.
I have asked my sister what toys she would want in the future, and she told me she would like a toy that has something to do with music. Speaking of music, I thought of the background music in the movie shows. So, the idea that I came up was a toy that can create music based on feelings. There will be a bracelet that can detect the user’s feelings and transfer the data to a toy. The toy can make a song that matches the user’s feelings.

## Finalized content 
I organized my notes by separating them into categories. I renamed my Part A into "**Software and Hardware that already exist**" and my Part B into "**Future Possible Technologies**". The three main categories I have in my Part A are Hardware, Software, and Both. I also have informations that do not fit into either categories which is Toy Careers. I decided to organize my notes this way because I looked at the [examples](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1w025TKLSU0PxNJAaa4OIykkkhQI8gbeYSwAY-GccYrM/preview) that Mr. Mueller gave us. I named by Part A like the first student did and have other imformations by themselves like the last student did. I make Part A into three categories because they are what Mr. Mueller told us to research for our Part A. 

## Engineering Design Process 
I am now in the **Brainstorm possible solutions** stage. I have brainstormed how technologies will impact toys and puzzles in the future. I have organized what I have researched and come up with possible future technologies that based on what I have found. My next step would be **Plan the most promising solution** which is to combine my notes and think of how will I put them into my website. 

## Skills 
### Communication 
I asked help from my sister and my partner, Ellen. When I can't think up any more ideas for **Future Possible Technologies**, I asked my sister for her thoughts. She had give me great feedbacks, and it helped me to think up the idea of "A toy that can create music based on the user's feelings." When I came up with a new idea, I told Ellen about it, and she helped me add more details to that idea.

### Organization 
I organized my notes into categories. I figured out which are hardwares, softwares, or both. I also looked at others' contents and websites to give myself some ideas about organization. When I am writing my notes, I put bullet points and sub-bullet points to make it clear for which details go with which idea.
