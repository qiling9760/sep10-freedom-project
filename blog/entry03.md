## Possible Future Technologies 
I have brainstormed ideas for possible future technologies. I get some of the ideas from technologies that already existed and think of how they can be improved. Other ideas I came up with were technologies I hope to get invented in the future. I also asked for help from my sister and partner (Ellen) to get more ideas. 

### Ideas that are based on existing technologies 
The two ideas I came up with are using holography in the toy industry and creating toys with imagination. 

#### Holography 
Holography is the production of 3 dimensional image of an object. Holograms are already in used in many industries such as visual art and architecture. My idea of using holograms in the toy industry is that toy makers can use holograms to present their products to the customers from every side of view, and customers can have a better understanding of the toy itself by looking at its 3D image. 

#### Creat toys with imagination 
In my research, I know that we can use 3D printer to print toys. However, 3D printing needs the user to make a digital file of the toy before printing it. So, I have an idea that in the future, there will be a machine that can be conrtolled by the user's mind and do not need the user to waste time on creating a 3D model. When the user think of the toys they want to make in their head, the machine will automatically creat the toys the user wants.
