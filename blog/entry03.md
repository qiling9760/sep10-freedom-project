## Possible Future Technologies 
I have brainstormed ideas for possible future technologies. I get some ideas from existing technologies and think about how to improve them. Other ideas I came up with were technologies I hope to get invented in the future. I also asked for help from my sister and partner (Ellen) to get more ideas. 

### Holography 
Holography is the production of 3-dimensional images of an object. Holograms could have an impact many industries such as [architecture](https://marvut.com/transforming-architectural-space-the-impact-of-hologram/ingles/#%253A~%253Atext%253DHowever%252C%2520holograms%2520go%2520further%252C%2520enabling%252C3D%2520renderings%2520of%2520their%2520designs.). My idea of using holograms in the toy industry is that toy makers can use holograms to present their products to the customers from every side of view. Customers can better understand the toy itself by looking at its 3D image. 

### Create toys with imagination 
In my research, I learned that we can use 3D printers to print toys. However, 3D printing needs the user to make a digital file of the toy before printing it. So, in the future, there will be a machine that can be controlled by the user's mind and does not need the user to waste time on creating a 3D model. When the user thinks of the toys they want to make in their head, the machine will automatically create the toys the user wants. 

### AI that can act like fictional characters 
Smart toys can talk, move, and interact with kids. However, the AI in the toys is all the same and needs to be more innovative to communicate with kids. In the future, I hope that there will be toys with AI that are smart enough to act like kids' favorite characters in a book/movie/game and talk to them. The AI will collect the character's information, such as their personalities and voices, and kids will have fun spending time communicating with people they like. 

### A technology that can turn life into puzzle games 
The new technology I thought up was smart glasses, just like VR glasses but much simpler. Smart glasses can turn ordinary events into challenges. When the user uses these smart glasses, it will make every small thing in life become a puzzle ready to be solved. 

### A toy that can create music based on the user's feelings.
I have asked my sister what toys she would want in the future, and she told me she would like a toy that has something to do with music. Speaking of music, I thought of the background music in the movie shows. The idea that I came up with was a toy that can create music based on feelings. There will be a bracelet that can detect the user's emotions and transfer the data to a toy. The toy can make a song that matches the user's feelings.

## Finalized content 
I organized my notes by separating them into categories. I renamed my Part A into "**Software and Hardware that already exist**" and my Part B into "**Future Possible Technologies**." The three main categories I have in my Part A are Hardware, Software, and Both. I also have information that does not fit into either category: Toy Careers. I decided to organize my notes this way because I looked at the [examples](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1w025TKLSU0PxNJAaa4OIykkkhQI8gbeYSwAY-GccYrM/preview) that Mr. Mueller gave us. I named Part A like the first student did and had other information by themselves as the last student did. I made Part A into three categories because they are what Mr. Mueller told us to research for Part A. 

## Engineering Design Process 
I am now in the **Brainstorm possible solutions** stage. I have brainstormed how technologies will impact toys and puzzles in the future. I have organized what I have researched and developed possible future technologies based on my findings. My next step is** Plan the most promising solution**, which is to combine my notes and think of how I will put them into my website. 

## Skills 
### Communication 
I asked for help from my sister and my partner, Ellen. When I couldn't think up any more ideas for **Future Possible Technologies**, I asked my sister for her thoughts. She gave me great feedback, which helped me think up the idea of "A toy that can create music based on the user's feelings." When I came up with a new idea, I told Ellen about it, and she helped me add more details.

### Organization 
I organized my notes into categories. I figured out which are hardware, software, or both. I also looked at others' content and websites to give myself some ideas about the organization. When writing my notes, I put bullet points and sub-bullet points to make it clear which details go with which idea.
