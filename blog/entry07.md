## Takeaways from giving in-calss presentaion 
I have made a slide show presentation for my in-class presentation of my Freedom Project. In the slides, I included what I had done before making my website, what I did when coding the website, and the tools that we learned on our own. I need to present my slides to my class with my partner Ellen.

There are some takeaways I got from presenting in front of my class:

- Eye contact - When I was presenting, I made little eye contact because I was afraid. After the presentation, my teacher gave me feedback, and he recommended me to make more eye contact. I know that eye contact is important because it lets your audience know that you are engaging with them. I will make more eye contact in the future when presenting.

- Make your slides simple - When making the slides, my teacher told us that we should not put paragraphs on our slides because it would look too crowded. We should also make the words on our slides big enough, so people far away can also see them. I understand that we should make our slides simple, so the audience would listen to us and not get distracted by the information on the slides.

- Know what you are going to say - It is important to know what you are going to say before you present because you don't want to stop and think while presenting. Knowing what you want to say beforehand also makes you more confident.

## Takeaways from giving Expo elevator pitch
I have made an elevator pitch for the Freedom Project Expo. In the elevator pitch, I talked about my topic, different sections of my website, and our tools. I presented the elevator pitch with my partner Ellen.

There are some takeaways I got from giving my elevator pitch:

- Have different elevator pitches for different people - I needed to present to different people, to judges, and to students who don't have SEP, so the things in my elevator pitch also need to be different. The judges had SEP before so I could simply how to make my website using HTML and CSS. But for the students who don't have SEP, I need to explain to them the coding language and tools I use like Bootstrap.

- Make the elevator pitch simple - I need to make my pitch simple because the judges only have one minute to listen to me. I need to show the most important things about my project to them.

- Do not over-explain - For students who don't have SEP, I should not get too deep about my tools and the coding process because they have no idea how they work. I should show them more about how the website works.

## EDP
I am currently on Communicate the Result where I had presented my website to other people. I talked about what I found about Toys and Puzzles and what products I made out of them. I explained my process of making my website about toys and puzzles.

## Skills
### Embracing failure
One skill I learned is embracing failure because I learned from my mistakes. I did not make enough eye contact when presenting in front of the class, so I am going to do better next time and make more eye contact.

### Organization
Another skill I learned is organization. I learned to organize everything I did in the past few months for my Freedom Project. I only put the important things in my presentation and did not let the unimportant things take up my time in the presentation and the elevator pitch.
