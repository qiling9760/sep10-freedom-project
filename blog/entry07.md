## Takeaways from giving in-calss presentaion 
I have made a [slide show presentation](https://qiling9760.github.io/sep10-freedom-project/toysproject/toy-index.html) for my in-class presentation of my Freedom Project. In the slides, I included what I have done before making my website, what I did when coding the website, and the tools that we learned on our own. I need to present my slides to my class with my partner Ellen. 

There are some takeaways I got from presenting in front of my class: 
- Eye contact - When I am presenting, I made little eye contact because I was afraid. After the presentation, my teacher gave me feedbacks, and he recommened me to make more eye contact. I know that eye contact is important because it let your audience know that you are engage with them. I will make more eye contact in the future when presenting. 

- Make your slides simple - When making the slides, my teacher told us that we should not put paragraphs on our slides because it would look too crowded. We should also make the words on our slides big enough, so people in the far can also see. I understand that we should make our slides simple, so the audience would listen to you and not get distracted by the  information on the slides. 

- Know what you are going to say - It is important to know what you are going to say before you present because you don't want to stop and think while presenting. Know what you want to say before hand also make you more confident. 

## Takeaways from giving Expo elevator pitch 
I have made an [elevator pitch](https://docs.google.com/document/d/106vSeo3k-M99-Bf328oMbOkHTRylpga8nKW-EO1nUDo/edit#heading=h.68gwumrierlm) for the Freedom Project Expo. In the elevator pitch, I talked about my topic, different sections of my website, and our tools. I presented the elevator pitch with my partner Ellen. 

There are some takeaways I got from giving my elevator pitch: 

- Have different elevator pitches for different people - I needed to present to different people, to judges and to students who don't have SEP, so the things in my elevator pitch also need to be different. For the judges, they had SEP before so I can simply on how I make my website using HTML and CSS. But for the students who don't have SEP, I need to explain to the what coding language and tools I used like Bootstrap. 

- Make the elevator pitch simple - I need to make my pitch simple because the judges only have one minute to listen to me. I need to show the most important things about my project to them. 

- Do not over explain - For students who don't have SEP, I should not get into too deep about my tools and the coding process because they had no idea how they work. I should show them more about how the website work. 

## EDP
I am currently on **Communicate the result** where I had presented my website to other people. I talked about what I found about **Toys and Puzzles** and what product I made out of it. I explained my process of making my website about toys and puzzles.
