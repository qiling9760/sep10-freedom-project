## Takeaways from giving in-calss presentaion 
I have made a [slide show presentation](https://qiling9760.github.io/sep10-freedom-project/toysproject/toy-index.html) for my in-class presentation of my Freedom Project. In the slides, I included what I have done before making my website, what I did when coding the website, and the tools that we learned on our own. I need to present my slides to my class with my partner Ellen. 

There are some takeaways I got from presenting in front of my class: 
- Eye contact - When I am presenting, I made little eye contact because I was afraid. After the presentation, my teacher gave me feedbacks, and he recommened me to make more eye contact. I know that eye contact is important because it let your audience know that you are engage with them. I will make more eye contact in the future when presenting. 

- Make your slides simple - When making the slides, my teacher told us that we should not put paragraphs on our slides because it would look too crowded. We should also make the words on our slides big enough, so people in the far can also see. I understand that we should make our slides simple, so the audience would listen to you and not get distracted by the  information on the slides. 

- Know what you are going to say - It is important to know what you are going to say before you present because you don't want to stop and think while presenting. Know what you want to say before hand also make you more confident.
