## Tool that I chose - SASS
I learned about the `@use` function, how to combine variables with operations, the "parent selector", the "placeholder selector" and the `@extend` function, variables, "private members", the `!default flag`, the `@forward` function, and the `@mixin` and `@include` functions. 

## Compile SCSS to CSS
At first, I did not know how to compile SCSS to CSS. I went on slack to see if someone can help me. One of my classmates Kyle who also chose SASS as his tool had the same problem as me. He asked his question, and Austin was able to help him out. Austin told us that we could install SASS using `npm install -g sass`. Then, we can use the `sass scss/style.scss css/style.css` command to compile our SCSS codes to CSS codes. I was able to use this command to compile codes when I am tinkering with SASS. 

Kyle later on told me another way that can compile SCSS to CSS, which is "Live Sass: Watch Sass". It will automatically compile SCSS code into CSS code without me writing the command in the terminal. But I did not like it, so I never use it.
