## Toys and Puzzles Website
After 9 months of searching for information and learning HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap, I have made a website about **Toys and Puzzles**. 

### Steps before coding 

#### Planing 
Before I can do anything else, I need to plan it first. I need to make two wireframes, one computer and one mobile. The website that we used to make our wireframes is [Wireframe.cc](https://wireframe.cc). My partner, Ellen, worked on the mobile wireframe, and I worked on the computer wireframe. Here are our wireframes:
- [Mobile](https://wireframe.cc/FoHNt8)
- [Computer](https://wireframe.cc/ziMqQp) 

The second thing we did after we finished our wireframes was to plan out the days that we will work on our project. We assigned specific parts that we need to do on specifc days, so we can work through out the break. 

#### Organize the content 
The first thing that I put on my plan was to organzie our content. We turned our research into paragraphs, so they look more organized. At first, they were just bullet points, but I made them into sentences and add more details.
