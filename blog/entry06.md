## Toys and Puzzles Website
After 9 months of searching for information and learning HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap, I have made a website about **Toys and Puzzles**. 

### Steps before coding 

#### Planing 
Before I can do anything else, I need to plan it first. I need to make two wireframes, one computer and one mobile. The website that we used to make our wireframes is [Wireframe.cc](https://wireframe.cc). My partner, Ellen, worked on the mobile wireframe, and I worked on the computer wireframe. Here are our wireframes:
- [Mobile](https://wireframe.cc/FoHNt8)
- [Computer](https://wireframe.cc/ziMqQp) 

The second thing we did after we finished our wireframes was to plan out the days that we will work on our project. We assigned specific parts that we need to do on specifc days, so we can work through out the break. 

```
* Task/Timeline

- 4/12/24 Friday - Plan
- 4/15+4/16 Monday + Tuesday - Finish/orgainzed content 
- 4/17/24 Wednesday - Find picture/research = navbar, homepage
- 4/18+4/19 Thursday + Friday - Present software
- 4/20+4/21 Saturday + Sunday - Present Hardware 
- 4/22+4/23 Monday + Tuesday - Present both 
- 4/24 - 4/27 Wednesday - Saturday - Future ideas 
- 4/28 Sunday - Aframe 
- 4/29 Monday - Add colors, fonts 
- 4/30 Tuesday - Check for requirements/relax 
```

#### Organize the content 
The first thing that I put on my plan was to organzie our content. We turned our research into paragraphs, so they look more organized. At first, they were just bullet points, but I made them into sentences and add more details.

### Coding 
We decide to use a Boostrap template for our project. I found a free template on [Start Boostrap](https://startbootstrap.com/) and downloaded to my computer and unzip it in my IDE. The [template](https://startbootstrap.com/theme/agency) was originally made for a porfolio, so it has sections that we don't need for our project. I deleted the images they provided and the sections that we are not going to use. Now, we have to find new images and replace the place holder text with our content. We also need to use our tool in our project. The tool that Ellen had was Aframe and mine was SASS. 

When we start working, we split up the work. I went to find images for the present technologies and upload them to GitHub, and Ellen drew the images for future technologies and link these images to the website. When she was working on her Aframe, I was putting our content into the website. We worked together and finished our minimum valueble product of our project before deadline. 

### Challenge 1  
The challenge that we faced when making our website was the images. The size of the images that I found on the internet were all different. I have tried to use CSS to change the size of these images, but they looked very ugly when I did that. Some of the images would get squezzed while others were perfect. So, Ellen and I went to find new images to place the old ones, and this time we select images that have similar sizes. 

### Challenge 2
The second challenge that we faced was our tools. For Ellen, she have to use Aframe to make a modal of our future technologies. One of the technology that we have was "A toy that can make music based on the userâ€™s feeling." For this toy, Ellen need to make modals for a bracelet and a speaker. She was struggling on making the bracelet, so we asked our other friends that also learned Aframe. One of our friend Xue helped us by giving us a idea of what code she can use. 

The challenge that I have on my tool was when I am compiling my SASS code to the CSS file that the template has, the code that I wrote override the code that the template has. This triggered me because I only wanted to change some part of the code and not all of them. When I went back to school and told my teacher about that, he said I can first copy all the CSS code to my SASS file then write my own code. 

### Takeaway
One takeaway that I have was decide whether we are going to use a template or not before we make our wireframes. Our project did not look like our wireframes because I have not decide to use a template or not when making our wireframe, so it came out that they did not match. Next time, I will consider that before I make the wireframes.
