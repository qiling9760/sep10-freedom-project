## Toys and Puzzles Website
After 9 months of searching for information and learning HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap, I have made a website about **Toys and Puzzles**. 

### Steps before coding 

#### Planing 
Before I can do anything else, I need to plan it first. I need to make two wireframes, one computer and one mobile. The website that we used to make our wireframes is [Wireframe.cc](https://wireframe.cc). My partner, Ellen, worked on the mobile wireframe, and I worked on the computer wireframe. Here are our wireframes:
- [Mobile](https://wireframe.cc/FoHNt8)
- [Computer](https://wireframe.cc/ziMqQp) 

The second thing we did after we finished our wireframes was to plan out the days that we will work on our project. We assigned specific parts that we need to do on specifc days, so we can work through out the break. 

```
* Task/Timeline

- 4/12/24 Friday - Plan

- 4/28 Sunday - Aframe 
- 4/29 Monday - Add colors, fonts 
- 4/30 Tuesday - Check for requirements/relax 
```

#### Organize the content 
The first thing that I put on my plan was to organzie our content. We turned our research into paragraphs, so they look more organized. At first, they were just bullet points, but I made them into sentences and add more details.

### Coding 
We decide to use a Boostrap template for our project. I found a free template on [Start Boostrap](https://startbootstrap.com/) and downloaded to my computer and unzip it in my IDE. The [template](https://startbootstrap.com/theme/agency) was originally made for a porfolio, so it has sections that we don't need for our project. I deleted the images they provided and the sections that we are not going to use. Now, we have to find new images and replace the place holder text with our content. We also need to use our tool in our project. The tool that Ellen had was Aframe and mine was SASS. 

When we start working, we split up the work. I went to find images for the present technologies and upload them to GitHub, and Ellen drew the images for future technologies and link these images to the website. When she was working on her Aframe, I was putting our content into the website. We worked together and finished our minimum valueble product of our project before deadline.
