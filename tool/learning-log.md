Tool: SASS

3/3/24
- I need to find a way to make SCSS compile to CSS.
  - I went on slack and saw Kyle asked the same question as me. Austin answered his question and reply with steps of how to do it, so I copied the codes he put to my IDE and it worked. 
    -  The code I used was `sass scss/style.scss css/style.css`
    - I learned that whenever I wrote `scss` codes, I need to use this code in my terminal to make it compile to my `css` file. 

- I made a variable for `border-width` and I put `$border: border-width: 2px;` but it does not work. It only work if I only put the `$border: 2px;`. And I would use my variable like 
``` CSS
p {
    border-width: $border;
}
``` 
- I learned that I can only put `variable: value` and cannot put `variable: property: value`.
