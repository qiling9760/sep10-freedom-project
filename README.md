# SEP10 Freedom Project
by **Qilin Guo**

## Context
I am a student at [HSTAT](https://www.hstat.org/) in the [Software Engineering Program](https://hstatsep.github.io/). The "Freedom Project" for SEP10 is a year-long project all about making a website that informs the viewer of the current and future innovations in the topic of my choosing.

For my project, I chose the topic of **Toys and Puzzles**. 

I used HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and Github. I also chose to independently study **SASS** in order to help me make by website.

## Content 
My blogs show the process of me making a webite about **Toys and Puzzles** for my Freedom Project. My blogs show what skills I have learned over the year to make my freedom project. It also included information that I put in my website and how I came up with them.

## Implications
##### PROS
* Individuals - Informed the readers about how toys and puzzles have been affected by technologies by showing them softwares and hardwares that already existed and realted to toys and puzzles. 
- Jobs - Gave ideas to toys designers about what kind of toys in the future they can make.   
- Finance - Companies may invest to create the new toys that I presented in my website. 
- Relationship - One of my future ideas involve sharing your life as a game, so this allows people to learn more about each other. 

##### CONS
* Laws - One of my future ideas involves using AI in the product, so there may be new laws created to indicate the limitations of the use of AI in the product. 
- Job - One of my futue ideas involves making toys on your own, so maybe in the future there will be less people buying toys and no one will make toys to sell.
